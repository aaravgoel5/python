# Hangman Game Project

## Overview
The Hangman Game project aimed to create a simple yet engaging Python game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word. The objective was to implement basic game logic, file handling, and user input validation while keeping the gameplay intuitive and entertaining.

## My Contribution 
As the sole developer of the project, I was responsible for designing and implementing the entire game logic, user interface, and error handling. My tasks included writing functions for choosing a random word from a file, displaying the word with guessed letters, managing user input, and determining win/lose conditions.

## Learning Experience
Through this project, I deepened my understanding of Python programming concepts such as file handling, exception handling, string manipulation, and conditional statements. I also honed my problem-solving skills by tackling challenges related to user input validation and game flow control.

## Challenges Overcame
One significant challenge was ensuring that the game handled various edge cases gracefully, such as empty word lists, non-existent word files, and invalid user input. I addressed these challenges by implementing robust error handling mechanisms and thorough input validation checks.

## Teamwork/Leadership  
Since this was an individual project, there were no explicit teamwork or leadership components involved. However, I demonstrated initiative and self-reliance by taking full ownership of the project from conception to completion. Additionally, I actively sought feedback from peers and mentors to refine the game and enhance its user experience.

# Address Book Management System

## Overview
The Address Book Management System project aimed to create a simple Python program for managing contact information. It provides functionalities such as adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting contacts from an address book.

## My Contribution
As the sole developer of the project, I designed and implemented the entire address book management system. This included defining the `Contact` and `AddressBook` classes, implementing methods for adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting contacts, and creating the main user interface loop.

## Learning Experience 
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python, including class and method definitions, encapsulation, and inheritance. I also enhanced my proficiency in handling user input, data manipulation, and error handling.

## Challenges Overcame 
One significant challenge was efficiently searching for contacts based on their names while handling case sensitivity and multiple matches. I addressed this challenge by using list comprehensions and implementing case-insensitive comparisons.

## Teamwork/Leadership
Since this was an individual project, there were no explicit teamwork or leadership components involved. However, I demonstrated self-reliance and initiative by independently managing the project from conception to completion. I also sought feedback from peers and mentors to improve the program's functionality and usability.
