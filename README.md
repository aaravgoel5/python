# Hangman Game Project

## Overview
The Hangman Game project aimed to create a simple yet engaging Python game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word. The objective was to implement basic game logic, file handling, and user input validation while keeping the gameplay intuitive and entertaining.

## My Contribution 
As the sole developer of the project, I was responsible for designing and implementing the entire game logic, user interface, and error handling. My tasks included writing functions for choosing a random word from a file, displaying the word with guessed letters, managing user input, and determining win/lose conditions.

## Learning Experience
Through this project, I deepened my understanding of Python programming concepts such as file handling, exception handling, string manipulation, and conditional statements. I also honed my problem-solving skills by tackling challenges related to user input validation and game flow control.

## Challenges Overcame
One significant challenge was ensuring that the game handled various edge cases gracefully, such as empty word lists, non-existent word files, and invalid user input. I addressed these challenges by implementing robust error handling mechanisms and thorough input validation checks.

## Teamwork/Leadership  
Since this was an individual project, there were no explicit teamwork or leadership components involved. However, I demonstrated initiative and self-reliance by taking full ownership of the project from conception to completion. Additionally, I actively sought feedback from peers and mentors to refine the game and enhance its user experience.

# Address Book Management System

## Overview
The Address Book Management System project aimed to create a simple Python program for managing contact information. It provides functionalities such as adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting contacts from an address book.

## My Contribution
As the sole developer of the project, I designed and implemented the entire address book management system. This included defining the `Contact` and `AddressBook` classes, implementing methods for adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting contacts, and creating the main user interface loop.

## Learning Experience 
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python, including class and method definitions, encapsulation, and inheritance. I also enhanced my proficiency in handling user input, data manipulation, and error handling.

## Challenges Overcame 
One significant challenge was efficiently searching for contacts based on their names while handling case sensitivity and multiple matches. I addressed this challenge by using list comprehensions and implementing case-insensitive comparisons.

## Teamwork/Leadership
Since this was an individual project, there were no explicit teamwork or leadership components involved. However, I demonstrated self-reliance and initiative by independently managing the project from conception to completion. I also sought feedback from peers and mentors to improve the program's functionality and usability.

# Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) AI

## Overview

The Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) AI project aimed to create a simple Python program for playing the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors against an AI opponent. The program allows users to input their moves (rock, paper, or scissors) and competes against the AI, which employs a basic strategy based on the user's previous moves.

## My Contribution

As the sole developer of the project, I designed and implemented the entire RPS AI system. This included defining the `RPS_AI` class with methods for predicting the AI's next move, updating transition probabilities based on user moves, and managing the game loop. Additionally, I implemented the `get_winner` function to determine the winner of each round based on the user's and AI's moves.

## Learning Experience

Through this project, I gained practical experience in Python programming, particularly in object-oriented design and implementation. I deepened my understanding of concepts such as class and method definitions, data structures, and conditional statements. Additionally, I improved my proficiency in user input handling, randomization, and algorithmic thinking.

## Challenges Overcame

One significant challenge was implementing the AI's strategy for predicting the user's next move and updating transition probabilities based on observed user behavior. I addressed this challenge by devising a simple strategy and refining it through experimentation and testing. Additionally, I encountered minor challenges related to input validation and error handling, which I resolved through careful debugging and refinement of the code.

## Teamwork/Leadership

Since this was an individual project, there were no explicit teamwork or leadership components involved. However, I demonstrated self-reliance and initiative by independently managing the project from conception to completion. I actively sought feedback from peers and mentors to refine the AI strategy and enhance the overall gameplay experience.

# Student Attendance Management System

## Overview

The Student Attendance Management System project aimed to create a simple Python program for managing student attendance records. It provides functionalities for marking attendance and viewing the attendance record.

## My Contribution

As the sole developer of the project, I designed and implemented the entire attendance management system. This included defining functions for taking attendance, viewing attendance records, and managing the main user interface loop.

## Learning Experience

Through this project, I gained practical experience in Python programming, particularly in function definitions, user input handling, and loop structures. I also enhanced my understanding of exception handling and error management, particularly in handling invalid input cases.

## Challenges Overcame

One significant challenge was implementing input validation for student IDs to ensure they were integers. I addressed this challenge by incorporating a try-except block to handle ValueError exceptions and prompt the user to enter a valid integer ID. Additionally, I encountered minor challenges related to managing the attendance record list and ensuring data consistency, which I resolved through careful debugging and testing.

## Teamwork/Leadership

Since this was an individual project, there were no explicit teamwork or leadership components involved. However, I demonstrated self-reliance and initiative by independently managing the project from conception to completion. I actively sought feedback from peers and mentors to refine the user interface and enhance the overall user experience.

# Simple Calculator App

## Overview

The Simple Calculator App project aimed to create a basic Python program for performing arithmetic calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square root operations. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting numbers and selecting operations.

## My Contribution

As the sole developer of the project, I designed and implemented the entire calculator application. This included defining the `Calculator` class with methods for performing arithmetic operations, implementing the user interface loop in the `main` function, and handling user input and error cases.

## Learning Experience

Through this project, I gained practical experience in Python programming, particularly in class and method definitions, user input handling, and conditional statements. I also enhanced my understanding of arithmetic operations, error handling, and code organization.

## Challenges Overcame

One significant challenge was implementing input validation for division to handle the case of division by zero. I addressed this challenge by adding a conditional check to prevent division by zero and returning an error message accordingly. Additionally, I encountered minor challenges related to handling negative numbers for square root calculations, which I resolved through careful error handling and testing.

## Teamwork/Leadership

Since this was an individual project, there were no explicit teamwork or leadership components involved. However, I demonstrated self-reliance and initiative by independently managing the project from conception to completion.
